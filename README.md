Pretrained Embeddings:
====
The pretrained character and word embeddings are the same with the embeddings in the baseline of [RichWordSegmentor](https://github.com/jiesutd/RichWordSegmentor)

Character embeddings: [gigaword_chn.all.a2b.uni.ite50.vec](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLO6T9D)

Word(Lattice) embeddings: [ctb.50d.vec](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLO6T9D)

How to run the code?
====
1. Download the character embeddings and word embeddings and put them in the `data` folder.
2. excute from command -- 'python lattice.py config.cfg'
